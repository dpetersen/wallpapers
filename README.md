# Wallpapers

These are a bunch of wallpapers that [my dotfiles](https://github.com/dpetersen/dotfiles) will reference. They're in a separate repository because, more often than not, I need my dotfiles in non-GUI environments.

My configs will expect these in `~/.local/share/wallpapers`, so get them into place with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpetersen/wallpapers.git ~/.local/share/wallpapers
```
